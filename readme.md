well here goes nothing... "hello world.  Klaatu barrada nicto."

Actually probably "Ben barrada nicto", given character names from the movie and apparent syntax.  "[computer name], [user name] barrada nicto".

My name is Ben, I am trying to engineer a career change for myself.  I've been working in pharmacy for about the last third of my life, from being a retail technician to now working as an analyst in the payer relations department.  I had to learn to use Quickbase for my current job, which ignited my interest in databases.  Of course man cannot live on databases alone, so as far as interface coding I'm currently learning Python.  I'll probably need to pick up node.js, and quite frankly anything else that anybody else recommends to me.  

I've always had a profound fascination for how the world works, and what small changes have what big effects and just generally making stuff work that didn't work before.  My purpose in life is to leave this world a better place than when I found it.  Only now as I'm approaching my forties have I cultivated the discipline and drive that would have made my life turn out very differently if I'd had them between high school and college.
